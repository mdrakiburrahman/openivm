# Grouped aggregates

> Linearity: **LINEAR** for SUM/COUNT; **NON_LINEAR** for MIN/MAX/AVG/STDDEV/LIST (group recompute). ([what does this mean?](../internals/linearity.md))

## Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (region VARCHAR, amount INT);
INSERT INTO sales VALUES ('US', 100), ('EU', 200);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
    SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM sales GROUP BY region;

INSERT INTO sales VALUES ('US', 50), ('JP', 300);
PRAGMA ivm('sales_summary');
```

## How IVM handles it

**Algebraic rule:**

```
new_MV[key] = old_MV[key] + delta_agg[key]
```

For each group key, the delta aggregate is computed from the delta table and merged with the existing value. New groups are inserted; groups whose aggregates reach zero are deleted.

The delta table is scanned, grouped by the same keys as the view, and consolidated into net changes per group. A `MERGE INTO` statement atomically updates existing groups and inserts new ones.

## Compiled SQL

### IVM query (delta computation)

```sql
-- Aggregate the delta rows, preserving multiplicity as a grouping key
-- This separates insertions from deletions so the upsert can fold them correctly
WITH scan_0 (...) AS (
    SELECT region, amount, _duckdb_ivm_multiplicity
    FROM delta_sales
    WHERE _duckdb_ivm_timestamp >= '...'
),
aggregate_1 (...) AS (
    SELECT region, _duckdb_ivm_multiplicity, sum(amount), count_star()
    FROM scan_0
    GROUP BY region, _duckdb_ivm_multiplicity
),
projection_2 (...) AS (
    SELECT region, sum_amount, count_star, _duckdb_ivm_multiplicity
    FROM aggregate_1
)
INSERT INTO delta_sales_summary (region, total, cnt, _duckdb_ivm_multiplicity)
SELECT * FROM projection_2;
```

### Upsert (MERGE)

```sql
-- Consolidate delta rows: fold insertions (+1) and deletions (-1) into a single net delta per group.
-- With integer-weighted multiplicity, this is just SUM(_w * col) — no CASE round-trip needed.
WITH ivm_cte AS (
    SELECT region,
        SUM(_duckdb_ivm_multiplicity * total) AS total,
        SUM(_duckdb_ivm_multiplicity * cnt) AS cnt
    FROM delta_sales_summary
    GROUP BY region
)
-- Single-pass MERGE: update existing groups and insert new ones atomically
-- IS NOT DISTINCT FROM handles NULL group keys correctly (NULL = NULL)
MERGE INTO sales_summary v USING ivm_cte d
ON v.region IS NOT DISTINCT FROM d.region
-- Existing group: add the net delta to the current aggregate values
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET total = v.total + d.total, cnt = v.cnt + d.cnt
-- New group: insert the delta as the initial value
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (region, total, cnt) VALUES (d.region, d.total, d.cnt);

-- Remove groups where all rows have been deleted (aggregates sum to zero)
DELETE FROM sales_summary WHERE total = 0 AND cnt = 0;
```

## Supported aggregates

| Function | Strategy | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `SUM` | Incremental (MERGE) | Delta added to existing value. |
| `COUNT`, `COUNT(*)` | Incremental (MERGE) | Delta added to existing count. |
| `AVG` | Incremental (decomposed) | Parser rewrites to hidden SUM + COUNT columns. MERGE updates both; AVG recomputed as SUM / NULLIF(COUNT, 0). |
| `MIN`, `MAX` | Group recompute | Affected groups deleted and re-inserted from the original query. Deleting the current min/max requires a full group rescan. |
| `HAVING` | Group recompute | Groups may enter or leave the result set after changes. |
| `STDDEV`, `STRING_AGG` | Full refresh | Automatically detected; view uses full recompute. |

## Expressions

Expressions inside aggregates work transparently:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv AS
    SELECT category,
        SUM(CASE WHEN value > 0 THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS positive_sum
    FROM t GROUP BY category;
```
