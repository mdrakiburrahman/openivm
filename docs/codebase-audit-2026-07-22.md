# OpenIVM codebase audit and remediation plan

Date: 2026-07-22

This audit covers the current working tree, including the in-progress nonlocal refresh changes. Findings were checked
from correctness, reliability, performance, simplicity, and code-hygiene perspectives. Confirmed bugs were reproduced
with real materialized views and refreshes rather than inferred only from static analysis.

The remediation rule is correctness first: an incrementalizable query must retain a correct incremental or affected-domain
maintenance path. A bug must not be hidden by weakening a test or silently changing the view to `FULL_REFRESH`.

## P0: correctness and transaction safety

- [x] **Capture delta rows in the base DML transaction.** Delta capture is now a streaming logical/physical operator that
  appends through the caller's `ClientContext`, so base DML and delta rows share one commit or rollback. A resolved
  catalog-level lock prevents refresh from advancing its watermark past an uncommitted delta. Regression coverage includes
  rollback, constraint failure, defaults, generated columns, `RETURNING`, and an uncommitted DML/refresh race.
- [x] **Capture actual `ON CONFLICT` outcomes.** Conflict clauses lower to `LogicalMergeInto`; a transparent physical action
  decorator now captures only the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rows selected by DuckDB after match and action predicates are
  resolved. Updates emit the required delete-old/insert-new pair, volatile defaults are evaluated once, `RETURNING` is
  preserved, and all writes remain in the base DML transaction. The same boundary also covers native `MERGE` actions.
- [x] **Make MV lifecycle and native refresh transactional.** Native CREATE, REPLACE, DROP, ALTER, and refresh inside an
  explicit caller transaction now mutate the user view, backing state, metadata, and deltas atomically and retain their
  OpenIVM locks through commit or rollback. Autocommit refresh temporarily retains the established locked executor because
  DuckDB query-pragma preprocessing ends a transaction before its returned program completes; `refresh.cpp` records the
  native-operator follow-up. DuckLake replacement materializes data and auxiliary state under unpublished staging names
  before publishing them.
- [x] **Continue cascade traversal when the current node has no source deltas.** Empty-delta detection now skips only the
  current node; it cannot terminate traversal of the downstream DAG. Regression coverage exercises both a pending parent
  delta left by a cascade-off refresh and independent child-source DML, including the hook-aware empty-node path.
- [x] **Use NULL-safe affected-window partition matching.** Affected-key refresh now uses hash-semi-joinable
  `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` predicates for standard, cascade, running-window, and DuckLake paths. Regression coverage includes
  batched conflicting DML on single and composite NULL partitions plus a DuckLake TPCC window whose delivery timestamp moves
  from the NULL partition to a non-NULL partition.
- [x] **Preserve `SUM` NULL semantics.** Weighted SUM alone cannot distinguish numeric zero from no non-NULL inputs. Persist
  a hidden `COUNT(sum_argument)` and render NULL when that count reaches zero.
- [x] **Use an unconditional row count for group existence.** `COUNT(nullable_expression)=0` does not mean a group is empty.
  Grouped incremental aggregates persist a hidden `COUNT(*)` solely for deciding whether the group row must be deleted,
  including aggregates below `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `TOP_N` wrappers.
- [ ] **Delete the heuristic group-measure update fast path.** `refresh_group_measure.cpp` infers aggregate lineage from SQL
  text, output-alias substrings, LPTS formatting, and value strings. A reproduced update to input `v` changed unrelated
  aliases `revenue` and `savings`. Use the existing affected-group recompute path until bound aggregate lineage can prove a
  safe fast path.
- [ ] **Validate the persisted `RefreshType` ABI.** Unknown values are raw-cast and can pass through refresh without applying
  data changes while still advancing the watermark. Give every persisted value an explicit ordinal and decode it through a
  single validating migration function; every dispatch must reject unknown values.
- [ ] **Give one refresh-node API ownership of hooks.** Scheduled hooks currently run twice, empty-delta skipping can suppress
  replace hooks, cascaded nodes bypass hooks, and hook errors are swallowed. Hooks, skip decisions, refresh, and error
  propagation must have exactly-once semantics.
- [ ] **Make crash recovery a durable state transition.** Some full-recompute paths bypass the in-progress journal, while
  recovery clears the journal before recovery succeeds. Persist an attempt/checkpoint before every data mutation and clear it
  only with successful post-refresh metadata.
- [ ] **Do not consume DuckLake structural-change identity before refresh succeeds.** Source-identity probing currently
  persists a new table ID immediately. Carry it as pending activity and commit it with the successful snapshot/watermark.

## P1: fail-closed metadata and authoritative planning

- [ ] **Distinguish metadata error, absence, and empty state.** Several getters convert query errors into `{}`, `false`, or a
  fallback strategy. Refresh must fail closed on schema/query errors; `optional` should mean genuinely absent metadata only.
- [ ] **Reject missing strategy contracts instead of falling through.** Missing DISTINCT or semi/anti metadata currently
  falls into unrelated compiler cases. Validate the selected strategy and all required metadata once before compilation.
- [ ] **Remove runtime type guessing from window lineage.** Bare-name `information_schema` lookup with `LIMIT 1` is ambiguous
  across schemas/catalogs, and coercing both comparison sides to VARCHAR changes bound comparison semantics. Persist exact
  bound cast chains and source identity at CREATE time.
- [ ] **Replace window partition metadata mini-parsing with a typed contract.** Partition columns, source expressions, casts,
  and lookup edges are reconstructed from independently encoded strings at refresh time. Persist one versioned structured
  representation, validate it atomically, and pass the decoded object through affected-partition compilation.
- [ ] **Make source identity fully qualified.** DML classification, metadata lookup, locking, cleanup, and dependency handling
  rely too heavily on bare table or view names. Use catalog, schema, and stable object identity.
- [ ] **Give one abstraction ownership of source and delta resolution.** Standard tables, DuckLake snapshots, chained views,
  legacy metadata, and attached catalogs are resolved in several compiler branches with slightly different fallback rules.
  Load and validate each source once into an immutable qualified descriptor, including its delta relation and snapshot range.
- [ ] **Centralize complete per-view DROP cleanup.** Hooks, refresh history/profile rows, dependency rows, and matcher state can
  survive DROP and be inherited by a newly created MV of the same name.
- [ ] **Preserve quoted output identifiers.** Planner output names are sanitized for internal use and then reused where the
  physical schema requires the original SQL identifier. Quoted names containing punctuation can fail during MV creation.
- [ ] **Classify only after required lineage is valid.** Window lineage can demote a finalized model to `FULL_REFRESH` after
  node maintenance and update semantics have already been derived, leaving contradictory model state.
- [x] **Remove deprecated refresh type value 10.** Deterministic SAMPLE, POSITIONAL, and ASOF shapes
  demote to full refresh. The separate current-diff affected-key mode remains part of group recompute; it is not a refresh
  type.
- [ ] **Strip computed top-k wrappers from stored aggregate state.** CREATE only moves a root `TOP_N` or
  `LIMIT -> ORDER_BY` into the user-facing view. Plans such as
  `PROJECTION -> TOP_N -> PROJECTION -> AGGREGATE` therefore initialize a limited backing table, while refresh strips the
  top-k operator and applies unbounded deltas. Resolve the bound ordering expressions through the projection path, keep the
  backing state unbounded, and apply the computed `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` only in the user-facing view.

## P2: remove SQL-text hacks and duplicate abstractions

- [ ] **Render Spark SQL by dialect instead of global regex replacement.** Whole-program replacement mutates literals,
  comments, and quoted identifiers, while early full-refresh paths bypass conversion entirely. Render casts, timestamps, and
  NULL-safe equality through dialect-aware builders/LPTS.
- [ ] **Replace affected-group source substitution with plan-node substitution.** Plain occurrence replacement can modify
  literals, comments, CTE references, and longer identifiers. Replace the exact `LogicalGet` occurrence before serialization.
- [x] **Delete the workload-specific TPC-DI left-join shortcut.** General refresh code hardcoded `fact_market_history`, three
  source names, and `sk_company_id`. Retain the generic correct path unless typed lineage proves a generic optimization.
- [ ] **Replace `parser_sql_extractors.cpp` with bound-plan extraction.** Its approximately 1,250 lines duplicate tokenization,
  quote handling, clause parsing, alias rewriting, and parenthesis tracking for DISTINCT, filtered aggregates, and semi/anti
  metadata already represented by bound logical operators and expressions.
- [ ] **Delete the independent refresh SQL mini-parsers.** Aggregate-filter stripping, SCD2 predicate injection, running-window
  parsing, and LPTS CTE parsing belong in logical-plan/AST construction, not four inconsistent scanners of emitted SQL.
- [ ] **Make the delta IR authoritative or remove its diagnostic-only graph.** Per-node maintenance, update semantics, generic
  affected domains, lineage facts, and auxiliary-state annotations are populated and logged but do not select compilation.
  Keeping them beside parallel `RefreshType`/metadata dispatch creates drift.
- [ ] **Remove the nonfunctional view-matching product surface until it has behavior.** Candidate lookup, canonicalization,
  and predicate implication are stubs, but settings, metadata columns, logs, CMake targets, and estimator APIs remain public.
  Keep the FK constraint functionality that is actually used.
- [ ] **Replace handwritten JSON and pipe-delimited lineage encoding.** Important semantic metadata is manually scanned and
  malformed fields can be skipped while keeping an incomplete lineage arm. Use typed normalized rows or a versioned structured
  serializer and reject malformed records as a whole.
- [ ] **Split CREATE and refresh into typed phase programs.** `PlanFunction` and `GenerateRefreshSQL` each span roughly a
  thousand lines. Use immutable inputs and results such as `ViewDefinition`, `RefreshMetadataSnapshot`, `PendingDeltaBatch`,
  `RefreshStrategy`, and `RefreshProgram`; do not introduce a class hierarchy.
- [ ] **Replace boolean/argument soup with strategy input/result structs.** Compiler functions with 17 parameters, output
  booleans, and implicit reclassification hide invariants and make call-order mistakes likely.
- [ ] **Use tagged CREATE operations instead of magic strings.** Cleanup, profiling, schema derivation, and executable SQL are
  currently mixed in one string vector and reparsed by prefixes and tab-delimited fields.
- [ ] **Consolidate duplicated profiling and NULL-safe predicate helpers.** `CreateMVProfiler` and `RefreshProfiler`
  independently implement IDs, retention, step collection, and persistence; SQL utilities contain parallel NULL-safe
  builders. Put the shared lifecycle and storage policy in one small profiler component.

## P3: refresh performance and repeated work

- [ ] **Remove exact base-table counting from normal join compilation.** Standard join refresh performs `COUNT(*)` for every
  base table on every refresh after delta activity has already been computed. Use activity/statistics or remove the heuristic.
- [ ] **Avoid repeated parse/bind/plan/model reconstruction.** Refresh planning currently reparses and optimizes the stored
  query multiple times. Persist a versioned create-time typed model and rebuild only for migration or invalidation.
- [ ] **Load metadata once.** `GenerateRefreshSQL` issues many independent queries for one view and sometimes reloads the same
  field. Load one immutable snapshot; keep writes and recovery checkpoints separate.
- [ ] **Consolidate projection deletes once.** The projection path builds the same grouped/ranked net delta independently for
  DELETE and INSERT. Materialize or share the consolidated batch.
- [ ] **Carry delta activity through the full refresh.** Activity checks, join-term selection, max timestamp lookup, and cleanup
  repeatedly scan the same delta tables. Capture count/delete/watermark information once per transaction. Explicit caller
  transactions currently remain conservative because query-pragma preprocessing cannot observe the caller's local delta
  rows or retain a reliable activity signal; solve this at the planned native refresh operator boundary rather than with
  process-global transaction registries.
- [x] **Share repeated LEFT JOIN transition-count subplans deliberately.** The join compiler now builds one explicit
  materialized transition-key CTE per nullable source/key and gives each inclusion-exclusion term a freshly bound CTE
  reference. This avoids the unsafe blanket common-subplan optimizer while preserving term-local bindings and delta
  semantics.
- [ ] **Price actual join work in the adaptive model.** The model counts exponential terms but underprices copied plan nodes,
  base-leaf appearances, compilation work, and generated SQL size.
- [ ] **Remove the fake `ConstraintCache` or make it a cache.** It repopulates a map that no read path consumes, while FK cost
  estimation separately parses textual constraint descriptions.
- [ ] **Audit edge-case tests and mirror them in the rewriter benchmark.** Review the SQL harness for missing boundary and
  transition cases, add deterministic bidirectional `EXCEPT ALL` coverage, and add representative cases to the rewriter
  benchmark so real refresh compilation and execution exercise the same semantics.
- [ ] **Add test-only concurrency barriers.** Several SQL concurrency regressions still coordinate with bounded sleeps.
  Introduce a deterministic handshake that can prove a writer or refresh owns or is waiting for the mutation gate without
  exposing a production pragma, then replace the timing assumptions in lifecycle tests.

## Target refresh flow

At CREATE time, bind once and persist a versioned typed view definition, delta plan, output schema, exact source identities,
and concrete strategy metadata.

At refresh time:

1. Acquire the graph/node transaction and locks.
2. Load one immutable metadata snapshot.
3. Capture one pending delta batch and its watermark.
4. Choose one explicit correctness-preserving strategy; use cost only between valid strategies.
5. Compile a structured refresh program containing data, cascade, cleanup, and checkpoint phases.
6. Execute native work atomically; render SQL once only at a genuine external-dialect boundary.
7. Commit data, cursor/snapshot, source identity, and recovery state together.
