# Refresh Strategies

OpenIVM supports three refresh strategies for materialized views: **auto**, **incremental**, and **full**. The strategy determines how `PRAGMA refresh('view_name')` applies pending changes.

## Refresh modes

The `openivm_refresh_mode` setting controls which strategy is used at refresh time.

| Mode            | Behavior |
|-----------------|---|
| `auto`          | The system decides. Uses incremental refresh when the view supports it; falls back to full refresh otherwise. |
| `incremental`  (default)  | Forces the IVM delta pipeline. Fails if the view was classified as `FULL_REFRESH` at creation time. |
| `full`          | Forces a complete DELETE + INSERT recomputation, regardless of whether the view supports IVM. |

```sql
-- Use incremental refresh (default)
SET openivm_refresh_mode = 'incremental';
PRAGMA refresh('monthly_totals');

-- Let the system decide (incremental when supported, full otherwise)
SET openivm_refresh_mode = 'auto';
PRAGMA refresh('monthly_totals');

-- Force full recomputation
SET openivm_refresh_mode = 'full';
PRAGMA refresh('monthly_totals');
```

## Upsert compilation by view type

The incremental refresh compiles different SQL depending on the view's `IVMType` (see [Parser: IVM compatibility classification](../internals/parser.md#ivm-compatibility-classification)).

| View type | Strategy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `AGGREGATE_GROUP` | `MERGE INTO` on GROUP BY keys | Each group is a unique row. MERGE updates existing groups and inserts new ones in a single pass. |
| `SIMPLE_AGGREGATE` | `UPDATE` (single row) | No GROUP BY means the MV always has exactly one row (SQL guarantees ungrouped aggregates return one row, even on empty input). A plain UPDATE is sufficient. |
| `SIMPLE_PROJECTION` | `DELETE` (rowid + ROW_NUMBER) then `INSERT` (generate_series) | No keys at all — the MV is a bag of tuples with valid duplicates. MERGE cannot target specific duplicate copies, so row-level addressing via rowid is required. |

For views containing `MIN`, `MAX`, or `HAVING`, a **group-recompute** strategy is used instead: affected groups are deleted and re-inserted from the original query.

MERGE requires a key to match source and target rows. `AGGREGATE_GROUP` views have natural keys (the GROUP BY columns), but the other two types do not:

- **Simple aggregates** have a single row with no key columns. MERGE would work (match on a dummy condition, always UPDATE), but adds complexity over a plain UPDATE for no benefit.
- **Projections/filters** allow duplicate rows. MERGE cannot express "delete exactly 3 copies of tuple (a, b) out of 7" — that requires rowid-based targeting.

## Adaptive cost model (experimental)

> **Note:** This feature is experimental. The cost model heuristics may change in future releases.

When `openivm_adaptive_refresh` is enabled, OpenIVM estimates the cost of incremental refresh versus full recomputation before each refresh and picks the cheaper option. This is useful when delta sizes vary unpredictably.

```sql
SET openivm_adaptive_refresh = true;
PRAGMA refresh('monthly_totals');
```

The cost model compares estimated cardinalities of the delta tables against the base tables. When `openivm_adaptive_refresh` is `false` (the default), the system always uses IVM for views that support it.

For FULL OUTER JOIN views, the static model applies higher upsert cost multipliers (3x for aggregates, 1.5x for projections) to account for the additional recompute phases (unmatched-row key extraction, NULL group recompute). The learned regression model self-corrects from execution history after a few refreshes.

### Inspecting the cost estimate

`PRAGMA refresh_cost('view_name')` returns the cost model's recommendation without performing a refresh.

```sql
PRAGMA refresh_cost('monthly_totals');
```

Returns a single row:

| decision | ivm_cost | recompute_cost |
|---|---|---|
| incremental | 1200.0 | 50000.0 |

- `decision`: `incremental` or `full`, based on which cost is lower.
- `ivm_cost`: estimated cost of applying deltas.
- `recompute_cost`: estimated cost of a full DELETE + INSERT.

## Automatic full-refresh detection

OpenIVM automatically classifies a view as full-refresh-only at creation time if its query contains constructs that cannot be maintained incrementally. No configuration is needed.

### Non-deterministic functions

Views that reference non-deterministic functions such as `RANDOM()` or `NOW()` are classified as `FULL_REFRESH`. The result of these functions can change between evaluations, so incremental deltas would be incorrect.

```sql
-- Automatically uses full refresh (RANDOM is non-deterministic)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sampled AS
  SELECT *, RANDOM() AS r FROM events;
```

### Unsupported operators

Views that use operators not yet supported for IVM are classified as `FULL_REFRESH` with a warning printed at creation time. Unsupported constructs include window functions over joins, unsupported semi/anti shapes, and aggregate functions outside the supported set.

`INNER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, arbitrary-predicate joins, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` are supported for incremental maintenance. Supported `SEMI JOIN`, `ANTI JOIN`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT EXISTS` projection shapes use an aux-state path.

```sql
-- Prints a warning; subsequent PRAGMA refresh() uses full refresh
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW with_unsupported AS
  SELECT MEDIAN(amount) FROM orders;
```

Supported aggregate functions include `COUNT`, `COUNT(*)`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `LIST`, `STDDEV`/`VARIANCE`, `BOOL_AND`, `BOOL_OR`, `ARG_MIN`, and `ARG_MAX`. Some use group recompute rather than pure MERGE.
