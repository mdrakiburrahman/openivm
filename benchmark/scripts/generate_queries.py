TPC-C Query Validator for OpenIVM Testing

Validates hand-written SQL queries against the TPC-C schema (and optionally a
DuckLake catalog for `ducklake_*.sql` files), extracts structural metadata,
and rewrites the leading `-- {JSON}` header used by the benchmark harness.

The Claude API calls that used to live here have been removed — new queries
are added by hand to benchmark/queries/ (or via the manual_queries() /
programmatic_queries() / composite_queries() builder helpers kept below for
reference).
