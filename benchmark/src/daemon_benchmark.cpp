//
// Daemon Benchmark: refresh + cascade + pipelines + concurrency coverage.
//
// Parent forks a setup child that creates the TPC-C DB, then forks one worker
// child per sub-test. The worker opens the DB, builds the sub-test's MV shape,
// runs concurrent DML + refresh + checker threads for `--duration` seconds,
// then emits a JSON summary line on its result pipe before exiting. The parent
// watches each worker via poll() and aggregates results into a JSONL file.
//
// Sub-tests exercise: automatic (daemon-scheduled) refresh, manual PRAGMA ivm(),
// upstream/downstream/both cascade modes, pipelines up to 10 MVs deep, parallel
// refresh across MVs, conflicting refresh on the same MV, ALTER REFRESH EVERY
// during a run, DML-during-refresh, and DuckLake variants.
